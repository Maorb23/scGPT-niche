# File Transfer to RunPod VM: Process and Conclusions

## Overview

This document summarizes the process of transferring large files to a RunPod virtual machine, the challenges encountered, and the solutions implemented. It serves as a reference for future file transfers to cloud VMs.

## Process Summary

1. **Repository Preparation**
   - Used `git filter-repo` to remove large files from Git history
   - Created `.gitignore` to prevent re-adding large files
   - Added `.gitkeep` files to maintain empty directory structure

2. **Connection to RunPod VM**
   - Identified correct SSH connection parameters (IP, port, username)
   - Verified SSH key authentication
   - Added the VM to known hosts

3. **Directory Preparation**
   - Created necessary directories on the VM
   - Set appropriate permissions

4. **File Transfer**
   - Used SCP with correct parameters for large file transfer
   - Verified successful transfer

## Challenges and Solutions

### Git Repository Management

**Challenge**: Large files in Git history causing slow clones and pushes.  
**Solution**: Used `git filter-repo` to remove large files from history while preserving the code.

```bash
git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 50M
